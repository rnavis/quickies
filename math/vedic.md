`Square of numbers` ==> ab == a^2 .2ab . b^2 (carry forward the reminder)

if divisor is 2^n or 5^n then remainder can be found by dividing by the last n digits alone.

  	``Division by 4`` ==> dividing by last 2 digits should give the divisibility of the number by 4.

  	``Division by 25`` ==> dividing by last 2 digits should give the divisibility of the number by 25.
